= Using a hash table =

A hash table allows the creation of collections as key/value pairs where they key is a string, and values can be quickly looked up using the string. A HashTable instance could be used as follows:

--- code ---
var myhashtable = HashTable.create();
myhashtable.set("key1", "First");
myhashtable.set("key2", "Second");
var ff = myhashtable.get("key2");
Log.message(ff); // Output: Second
--- code ---
